Description

This repository contains a lightweight demo frontend for a Solana-based prediction market.
It is designed to showcase the concept and UI without exposing production logic, smart contract code, or backend integrations.

What this demo includes
Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
A mock "Connect Wallet" button (simulated only).
A demo "Create Market" form that builds market cards in-memory.
Preloaded mock markets displayed as example cards.
What this demo does not include
No backend/API calls.
No Solana smart contract logic.
No real wallet or transaction support.
Intended use

This repo can be shared publicly on GitHub to:
